## ðŸ“Œ Method Call Stack

The method call stack tracks the sequence of method invocations during program execution. Each time a method is called, a new stack frame is added to store its parameters and local variables. As methods complete, their frames are removed from the stack.![alt text](image-1.png)

## ðŸ”„ Exception Propagation

When an exception arises, Java searches upward through the call stack for a matching catch block. This process, known as exception propagation, continues until an appropriate handler is found. If none exists, the program terminates with an uncaught exception.

## ðŸ§¹ Finally Block

The finally block is designed to execute after the try-catch structure, whether or not an exception was thrown. It's typically used for cleanup operationsâ€”like closing files, releasing resources, or loggingâ€”ensuring consistent program behavior.

Understanding these components helps developers build robust and maintainable applications.
