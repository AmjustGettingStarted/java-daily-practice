# Error Handling using Try & Catch Block

In Java, error handling is managed through a structured mechanism known as **exception handling**. This allows developers to manage runtime errors effectively, preserving the flow and reliability of the application.

## Purpose of Try-Catch Blocks

The `try-catch` construct helps isolate risky operations—such as file access, network communication, and user input parsing—into protected sections. This ensures that if an unexpected error occurs, it can be caught and handled without crashing the program.

## Structure and Flow

The `try` block contains the code segment that might throw an exception. If an error arises, the corresponding `catch` block is executed. This block contains logic to handle the exception, such as displaying an error message or triggering fallback behavior.

## Multiple Catch Blocks

Java allows multiple `catch` blocks to handle different types of exceptions separately. This makes it easier to respond to specific error conditions with tailored actions.

## Nested Try-Catch

A `try` block can be nested within another `try` block. This is particularly useful in complex scenarios where different operations may require separate error-handling strategies.

## The Finally Clause

An optional `finally` block can be added after the `catch` blocks. This block executes regardless of whether an exception is thrown and is typically used for resource cleanup, like closing files or releasing network connections.

## Benefits of Exception Handling

- **Robustness**: Prevents abrupt termination due to unexpected errors.
- **Clarity**: Separates normal logic from error-handling code.
- **Maintainability**: Enhances readability and future-proofing by isolating error-specific logic.

Exception handling through `try-catch` blocks is a cornerstone of writing resilient and maintainable Java applications.
