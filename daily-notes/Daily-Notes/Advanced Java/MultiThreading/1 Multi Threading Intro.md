# `Multi Threading (Introduction)`

# **Thread**

## ðŸ§µ What is a **Thread** in Java?

A **thread** in Java represents a **lightweight unit of execution**. It's a way for a program to perform **multiple tasks concurrently**, enabling better resource utilization and responsiveness.

# MultiThreading

**Multithreading** is a Java feature that allows **multiple threads** to run concurrently within a single program. Itâ€™s like having several mini-programs (threads) inside one main program (process), all working at the same time to perform different tasks.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Multithreading?

- Makes programs **faster and more responsive**
- Ideal for tasks like file I/O, user interactions, animations, network requests
- Allows **efficient use of CPU resources**

## ðŸ§µ Thread vs Multithreading

| Concept    | Thread                     | Multithreading                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Definition | Smallest unit of execution | Running multiple threads simultaneously   |
| Example    | One chef in a kitchen      | Several chefs working on different dishes |
| Goal       | One task at a time         | Multiple tasks at once                    |

## ðŸ§  Multitasking vs Multithreading

- **Multitasking**:

  - Executes multiple processes/tasks at once.
  - Each task may run independently in its own memory space.
  - Examples:
    - Listening to music while browsing.
    - Running multiple applications (browser, editor, media player).

- **Multithreading**:
  - A subset of multitasking.
  - A single process divided into multiple threads that run concurrently.
  - Threads **share memory** and resources.
  - More efficient than multitasking.
  - Example:
    - Downloading a file while browsing other web pages.
