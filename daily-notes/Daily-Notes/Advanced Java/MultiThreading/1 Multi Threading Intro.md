# `Multi Threading (Introduction)`

# **Thread**

## 🧵 What is a **Thread** in Java?

A **thread** in Java represents a **lightweight unit of execution**. It's a way for a program to perform **multiple tasks concurrently**, enabling better resource utilization and responsiveness.

# MultiThreading

**Multithreading** is a Java feature that allows **multiple threads** to run concurrently within a single program. It’s like having several mini-programs (threads) inside one main program (process), all working at the same time to perform different tasks.

## 💡 Why Multithreading?

- Makes programs **faster and more responsive**
- Ideal for tasks like file I/O, user interactions, animations, network requests
- Allows **efficient use of CPU resources**

## 🧵 Thread vs Multithreading

| Concept    | Thread                     | Multithreading                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Definition | Smallest unit of execution | Running multiple threads simultaneously   |
| Example    | One chef in a kitchen      | Several chefs working on different dishes |
| Goal       | One task at a time         | Multiple tasks at once                    |
