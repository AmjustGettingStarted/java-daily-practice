# 🔷 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java

## 🧠 What is OOP?

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a paradigm that structures software around **objects**—bundles of data and behaviors—which interact to build complex, scalable systems.

- **Class**: A blueprint that defines the structure and behavior of objects. It encapsulates data members (fields) and methods.
- **Object**: An instance of a class with real data. Each object has its own state and behavior based on its class.

📌 _Example: A `Car` class defines attributes like brand, color, and model. Each `Car` object will have specific values for these attributes._

## 🆚 Functional Programming vs. Object-Oriented Programming

| Feature          | Functional Programming               | Object-Oriented Programming                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Focus**        | Functions and transformations        | Real-world entities modeled as interacting objects                 |
| **Use Case**     | Small, simple tasks or automation    | Large, modular systems with entities like students, teachers, etc. |
| **Data & State** | Avoids shared state and mutable data | Embraces shared state and behavior via encapsulated objects        |
| **Design Style** | Declarative: what to do              | Imperative: how to do it using objects                             |

## ✅ Advantages of Object-Oriented Programming

- **Modularity**  
  Code is logically divided into self-contained classes, improving maintainability.

- **Reusability**  
  Once defined, classes can be reused across multiple applications.

- **Scalability**  
  New functionality can be added easily by extending existing classes.

- **Error Reduction**  
  Encapsulation and abstraction help isolate concerns and prevent invalid object states.
