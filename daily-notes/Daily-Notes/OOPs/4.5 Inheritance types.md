# ðŸŒ³ Java Inheritance Types

Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviors of another. Java supports several types of inheritance, each with its own structure and use case.

## 1. Single Inheritance

Single inheritance occurs when one class inherits from a single base class. This is the simplest form of inheritance, where the derived class extends the functionality of its parent.

**Example:**  
A base class `A` can have a derived class `B`.

## 2. Multilevel Inheritance

In multilevel inheritance, a derived class inherits from a base class, and then another class inherits from that derived class, forming a chain.

**Example:**  
Class `A` â†’ Class `B` â†’ Class `C`

## 3. Hierarchical Inheritance

In hierarchical inheritance, one class serves as a superclass for more than one subclass.

**Example:**  
Class `A` is a base class for classes `B`, `C`, and `D`.

## 4. Multiple Inheritance (Through Interfaces)

Multiple inheritance refers to a scenario where a single class inherits from more than one parent class.

> **Note:**  
> Java does **not** allow multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity problems. However, Java allows multiple inheritance using interfaces.

**Ambiguity Example:**  
If both class `A` and class `B` have a method named `display()`, and class `C` inherits from both, the compiler cannot determine which `display()` method to use.

**Java Solution:**  
A class can implement multiple interfaces, and an interface can extend multiple other interfaces.

## 5. Hybrid Inheritance

Hybrid inheritance is a combination of two or more types of inheritance (e.g., hierarchical and multilevel). While not directly supported with classes in Java, it is possible through interfaces.

**Example:**  
A class can implement multiple interfaces, combining functionalities from various sources.
