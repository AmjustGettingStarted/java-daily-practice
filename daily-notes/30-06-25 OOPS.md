## ✅ Topics Covered

Today, I focused on revising and deepening my understanding of key Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Java from the GeeksforGeeks course:

## 📘 Key Concepts Learned

- **Class & Object**: The fundamental building blocks of OOP in Java.
- **Encapsulation**: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit to protect internal state.
- **Inheritance**: Reusability of code by deriving child classes from a base class.
- **Polymorphism**: Ability of objects to take multiple forms—compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
- **Abstraction**: Hiding complexity by exposing only relevant functionalities via abstract classes or interfaces.
- **Interfaces vs Abstract Classes**: Interfaces support full abstraction; abstract classes can have partial abstraction and shared code.

## 💡 Reflections

Reading through all these articles gave me a strong conceptual foundation in Java OOP. I now feel more confident distinguishing between when to use inheritance versus composition, and how abstraction helps structure large-scale systems.

> 🚀 **Tomorrow’s goal**: Practice implementing a small real-world system using OOP (e.g., library management or student database).
