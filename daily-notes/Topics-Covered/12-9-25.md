## 1️⃣ Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Problem: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array—you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example: Input: [1,1,2] Output: [1,2,_], return length 2

Why it’s similar: You’ll use two pointers—one to scan the array and one to track the position of the next unique element.

## 2️⃣ Sort Colors (a.k.a. Dutch National Flag Problem)

Problem: Given an array nums with values 0, 1, and 2, sort them in-place so that all 0s come first, followed by 1s, then 2s.

Example: Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0] Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Why it’s similar: This problem also uses multiple pointers to rearrange elements in-place without extra space, and it builds on the idea of partitioning the array based on values.
