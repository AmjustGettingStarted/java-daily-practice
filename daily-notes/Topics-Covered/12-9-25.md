## 1️⃣ Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Problem: Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length. Do not allocate extra space for another array—you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example: Input: [1,1,2] Output: [1,2,_], return length 2

Why it’s similar: You’ll use two pointers—one to scan the array and one to track the position of the next unique element.
