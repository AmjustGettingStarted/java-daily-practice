## LeetCode

Revison

- 41
- 238
- 169 Majority Element

---

## Linked List

- 2 constructors
- stores in nodes
- no initial capacity or incremental capacity
- 3 implementaion clases

---

## Array List vs Linked List

- AL used when storing or retrieving of objects in a collection (sequential memory)
- LL used when we need to insert or delete objects in between (Non Sequential Memory)

---

## Data Types

- Primitive Data Types -> 8
- Non Primitive Data Types -> 8

---

## Wrapper Classes

> Non Primitive version of primitve data types is called Wrapper Class

- Auto boxing -> primitive to non primitive
- Auto unboxing -> Non primitive to primitive

---

## Generics

- < > -> Element Type of Collection

---

## Vector
