# topics Covered

## Mutli Threading

- Thread is a predefined class in java.lang package
- Thread is a light weight sub process of a sub task
- Task is divided into subtask, each subtask is a thread
- Process of executing multiple threads at the same time is called as multi threading

## Properties

- ThreadId -> uniquely identify a thread
- ThreadName -> easily identify a thread
- ThreadPriority -> order of execution of a specific thread -> 1 to 10 priority, 1 is the least priority, 5 is default, 10 is highest priority
- All these 3 are private data members

## Important methods

- getId()
- getName()
- setName()
- getPriority()
- setPriority()
- start()
- run()
- sleep()
- stop()
- currentThread()

> Thread is used to create user defined threads
> If is-a-relationship occurs, Runnable interface is used to create user defined threads

## Constructors

- Thread()
- Thread(String name)
- Thread(Runnable obj)
- Thread(Runnable obj, String name)

## Pre defined Threads

- main Thread -> Runs the threads
- thread scheduler -> manages the threads
- Garbage collector -> Deletes dereferenced objs and unused objs

## Life Cycle of Thread

- new -> the thread is created
- runnable -> Ready for execution
- running -> Thread is executing
- dead -> Thread is terminated

> Once a thread is executed, it is automatically terminated hence we cannot start a thread twice...
