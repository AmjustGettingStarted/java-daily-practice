### 📘 Articles Studied

- **Multithreading Introduction**  
  Understood the basics of creating and managing threads, enabling parallel execution for better performance.

- **Multithreading in Java**  
  Explored synchronization, inter-thread communication, and thread lifecycle management for building robust concurrent systems.

- **File Handling in Java**  
  Examined how to read, write, and manipulate files using various I/O classes from the `java.io` package.

- **Create and Get Information**  
  Practiced using `createNewFile()`, `mkdir()`, and metadata methods like `getName()` and `lastModified()` to interact with the filesystem.

- **Reading and Writing in a File in Java**  
  Mastered techniques for performing efficient character and byte stream operations, using classes like `FileWriter`, `BufferedReader`, and `FileInputStream`.

## ✨ Highlights & Insights

- Learned to distinguish between **thread-based concurrency** vs traditional sequential execution, highlighting performance gains in real-world scenarios.
- Gained hands-on experience with **thread lifecycle** and synchronization — including proper locking strategies to prevent race conditions.
- Clarified usage and intent of core **file handling methods** like `mkdir()`, `createNewFile()`, and `exists()`, avoiding common pitfalls.
- Developed a program that creates, writes to, and reads from a text file — reinforcing best practices around stream management and error handling.
- Applied both **character and byte streams** to handle textual and binary content, adapting to different file types and use cases.
