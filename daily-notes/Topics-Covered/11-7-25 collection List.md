## ✅ **Topics Covered**

Today's exploration delved into the **Java Collections Framework**, decoding its hierarchical structure and understanding how various List implementations operate under the hood. It reinforced how choosing the right collection depends on performance, access patterns, and manipulation needs.

### 📘 **Articles Studied**

- **Java Collections Framework Overview**  
  Understood the architecture of interfaces, concrete implementations, and utility algorithms that streamline data structure operations in Java.

- **Collection Hierarchy**  
  Explored the inheritance tree starting from `Iterable`, expanding into `Collection`, `List`, `Set`, and `Queue`.

- **List Interface and Implementations**  
  Examined how `List` supports ordered collections with duplicates, and how different classes serve specific needs:
  
  - `ArrayList` → Backed by a resizable array; ideal for fast access.
  - `LinkedList` → Built on doubly-linked nodes; optimized for frequent insertions/deletions.
  - `Vector` → Legacy, synchronized resizable array; expanded in multiples of two.
  - `Stack` → LIFO structure extending `Vector`; uses `push` and `pop` for manipulation.
