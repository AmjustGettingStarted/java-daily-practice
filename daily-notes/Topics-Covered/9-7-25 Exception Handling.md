## ✅ Topics Covered

Today’s session deepened my understanding of **exception handling mechanisms in Java**, with a sharp focus on controlling runtime anomalies and structuring predictable error recovery.

---

### 📘 Articles Studied

- **Exception Handling using Try-Catch**  
  Explored how try-catch blocks isolate risky code and allow graceful recovery through targeted exception handling.

- **Method Call Stack and Exceptions**  
  Studied how the stack stores method calls and how exception propagation moves through it using FILO logic.

- **Exception Handling using Throw and Throws**  
  Learned how to explicitly throw exceptions with `throw` and declare exception expectations using `throws`.

## ✨ Highlights & Insights

- Strengthened understanding of **structured error handling** using `try`, `catch`, and `finally` for flow resilience.
- Visualized **exception propagation** as a top-down journey through the **call stack**, tracing the origin and escalation of errors.
- Clarified usage of `throw` vs `throws`—knowing when to launch an exception and when to declare potential ones.
